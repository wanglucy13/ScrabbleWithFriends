Scrabble With Friends was created by Din Allal, Wyatt Kim, Sagar Mittal, Jonathan Wang and Lucy Wang.
This is our final project for our CSCI 201 course at USC.
This program includes user login functionality, multi-threading and networking.
It was written in Java and incorporates Swing in order to create the GUI.
We learned a lot about the different phases of software engineering throughout this project.
We hope you enjoy using this program!
